My solutions for Advent of Code 2024

Current stars: 11

Goals for this year:
- Get more stars than 2023 before 2025 Advent of Code
    - 2023 standing: 41 stars
- Understand and improve the algorithms used and time and space complexity in solutions
    - 2023 was about simply solving the problem
    - Research and study algorithms that can be used before attempting to solve the problem
    - Attempt to improve time and space complexities by being more conscious about the solutions rather than just getting the right answer
- Document code better for others to understand
    - If I would like to share my skills with others, code needs to be cleaner and better documented
    - Add more comments throughout the code
- Improve the string methods that convert the input into the models
    - 2023 methods were a bit rough as Swift is not the best at dealing with strings
    - Learn better Swift built in methods to convert inputs into the models I create
    - Use ChatGPT to help with this. This should be fine becuase Advent of code is not about converting Strings but rather solving the core problem. This way I can learn better Swift string algorithms and improve on how I deal with strings.
